# Data Cleaning Project Using Microsoft SQL Server

A SQL data cleaning project using the Nashville housing dataset. 

### The following task completed for this project:
- Standardized date format using `CAST` and updated the table. 
- By using a `SELF JOIN`, populated the *PropertyAddress* fields where the value is `NULL`.
- Broken out *PropertyAddress* and *OwnerAddress* fields into individual columns using `SUBSTRING` and `PARSENAME` functions.
- Changing Y and N to Yes and No in the *SoldAsVacant* field using `CASE` statement. 
- Removed Duplicates using `ROW_NUMBER`, `PARTITION BY`, and `CTE`. 
- Deleted a few unused fields using the `DROP` command.
